## Abstract

Due to it's central location in the United States, Kansas City, Missouri is
a prime location for not only distribution centers but the freight car industry. It is estimated that because of its location, 85 percent of the US population could be reached within two days of shipping and freight logistics. It is predicted that between 2016 and 2027, the shipping by truck industry will grow by 27 percent; that's growth from an already staggering $796.7 billion total revenue industry (Statista, 2018). As such, the industry demands a smarter solution to price trips before they happen, so that less operational costs can be spent on coordination of resources and more money can be put to the salaries of drivers and truck maintenance. Thus, in this capstone project, I will introduce a machine learning model that predicts shipping prices on a smaller attainable market: that of the $12 billion per year vehicle shipping services. My goal is to present both supervised (multiple linear regression), unsupervised (clustering), and ensemble (random forest regressor) learning models and deploy one of them to a requestable API used the FastAPI and Cortex technologies, which have been recently developed. 

## Some Notes Before We Proceed

* This work was done simulataneously as a work project for my career at a small startup in Kansas City called Bellwethr for another small startup in  the freight space called SuperDispatch. 
* In the project, you may see some acronyms like sd (SuperDispatch) to signify various variables and file assignments
* The data will be hidden from plain view and added to a .gitignore folder as it is proprietary and I did not previously go through the correct channels to have it shown on this repository
